\begin{abstract}
Julia is a dynamic language for scientific computing. For a dynamic language,
Julia is surprisingly typefull. Types are used not only to structure data but
also to guide dynamic dispatch â€“ the main design tool in the language. No
matter the dynamism, Julia is performant: flexibility is compiled away at the
run time using a simple but smart type-specialization based optimization
technique called type stability. Based on a model of a JIT mimicking Julia
from previous works, we present the first algorithm to approximate type
stability of Julia code. Implementation and evaluation of the algorithm is
still a work in progress.
